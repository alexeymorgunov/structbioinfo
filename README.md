# Structural bioinformatics practical

**Part II BBS Bioinformatics** - 16:00-18:00, 5 Mar 2018

Instructions for the practical are below. [Answers](Answers.md) are available for reference.

Just in case, I've made available all the [files](files) that you are otherwise supposed to download throughout the practical from their original sources.

1. **Finding the right structures.**

We are interested in analysing the structure of a protein called arginine-tRNA ligase (synthetase) from the yeast _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_.

a) Go to [UniProt](http://www.uniprot.org/) and find the entry corresponding to this protein using the search bar. Take a look around at the available information. Feel free to click through to various databases to familiarise yourself with what UniProt aggregates.

b) Download the `.fasta` file containing the sequence of our protein. We'll need it later.
